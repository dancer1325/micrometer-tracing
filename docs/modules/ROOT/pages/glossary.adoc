* Micrometer Tracing
    ** == core module + set of modules +  another set of modules
        *** core module / has an instrumentation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_provider_interface[SPI]
        *** set of modules / has bridges to various tracers
        *** another set of modules / has dedicated span reporting mechanisms & a test kit
    ** terminology -- borrowed from -- https://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html[Dapper's] terminology.

* *Span*
    ** := basic unit of work
        *** _Example1:_ sending an RPC == new span,
        *** __Example2:__ sending a response to an RPC == new span
        ** contain other data
            *** descriptions
            *** timestamped events
            *** key-value annotations (tags)
            *** ID of the span / caused them
            *** process IDs (normally IP addresses)
        ** can be
            *** started
                **** once you create & start -> you must stop | some point in the future
            *** stopped
        ** uses
            *** keep track of their timing information
    ** _Example:_ parent-child relationships of spans

* *Trace*
    ** := set of spans / tree-like structure
        *** Example: if you run a distributed big-data store -> trace -- might be formed by a -- `PUT` request
    ** _Example:_ *Span* and *Trace* | system
        *** different color / span
            **** [*A*, *G*]
        *** comprehend each note
            **** _Example1_

                Trace Id = X
                Span Id = D
                Client Sent

                ***** span with `TraceId=X`, and `spanId=D`
                ***** `Client Sent` event took place -- from -- RPC perspective
            **** _Example2_

                Trace Id = X
                Span Id = A
                (no custom span)

                ***** `no custom span` == created span
            **** _Example3_

                Trace Id = X
                Span Id = C
                (custom span)

                ***** `custom span` == you can create child spans manually

* *Annotation/Event*
    ** uses
        *** record the existence of an event / in time

* *Tracer*
    ** := library /
        *** handles the lifecycle of a span
            **** create spans
            **** start spans
            **** stop spans
            **** report spans -- via reporters / exporters, to an -- external system

* *Tracing context*
    ** == trace identifier + span identifier
        *** must be propagated
            **** through the process ( -- _Example:_ over threads --)
            **** over the network
    ** uses
        *** make work distributed tracing

* *Log correlation*
    ** == parts of the tracing context
        *** _Example:_ trace identifier & span identifier
    ** -- can be populated to the -- logs of a given application
    ** uses
        *** collect ALL logs | 1! storage &
        *** group -- via a -- trace ID

* *Latency analysis tools*
    ** := tool /
        *** collects exported spans
        *** visualizes the WHOLE trace
